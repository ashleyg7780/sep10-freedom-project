* Robotic machines that scan animals for any diseases

  * Surgery robots that actually do work
They have robots that help with surgery but it would be better if robots did the work that way its more easier and faster.

   * A gas machine (anesthesia)
Animals can be aggressive sometimes making it hard to put them into anesthesia before working on them, a machine that puts them with anesthesia will help with causing no harm or accidents the animal or doctor may cause
